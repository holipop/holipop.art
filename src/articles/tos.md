# General Terms
- __By commissioning me, you agree to these terms.__
- __I reserve the right to turn down any commission.__
- __You must be 18 or older to commission me.__
- __Payments are done via PayPal.__
- __Payments are up-front.__ However, I am always open to discuss payment plans if you'd prefer to pay in increments.
- __You must have at least one visual reference for submission.__ Any relevant reference may do, even if it's just a stick figure thumbnail sketch. A picture is a lot easier to interpret than a lengthy description, but feel free to be descriptive.
- __Complexity may affect price.__ Depending on the props, patterns, and/or background requested, there will be an additional charge on top of the base price.
- __After payment is processed and the sketch is finished, refunds are not allowed. No exceptions.__

# Distribution
- You, the commissioner, are allowed to copy and redistribute your commission. This includes posting online or printing it for personal use. I cannot revoke these freedoms so long as you follow the terms of service.
- __Attribution.__ You must give appropriate credit where ever your commission is shared/used (e.g. using it as a profile picture, posting it on social media).
- __Non-Commercial.__ You cannot use your commission for any commercial purposes.
- __No Derivatives.__ If you remix, modify, or transform the commission, you may not share the modified artwork. _This includes removing/blurring/cropping the watermark and signature._

# Commission Process
In general, it takes me about a 1 to 4 weeks to finish a commission depending on the complexity. Here's the general process:

- If I've accepted your commission, I'll discuss with you on ideas for your piece and ask for clarification if needed. Before you pay, I'll do some thumbnail sketches just to make sure we're on the same page. If your commission seems to complex for the base price, this is the part where we'd negotiate.
- Once I finish those sketches and you're happy with them, I'll send you an invoice on PayPal via email and start working when payment is completed. Be sure to let me know if I have full creative control on a piece or you'd like to keep an eye on the progress.
- As I work, I'll be sending WIP pictures here and there so I can clarify or brainstorm with you on certain aspects. If anything needs changing, don't be afraid to let me know earlier than later!
- Once it's done, I'll send you the full resolution image via Google Drive and you're free to use it where ever you like. Most of the time I post it on all of my socials and mention the client, but if you'd prefer to keep it private then do let me know.

# Preferences
Most of these aren't hard guidelines but recommendations for increasing the likelihood of your commission getting accepted.

## What I Like to Draw
- __Pin-Ups!__
- __Fun Outfits.__ These range from the kind of cutesy/promiscuous outfits to stylish/aesthetically pleasing outfits. (or both!)
- __Affirming Body Types.__ I pride myself in being able to draw any body type. If you want your character(s) drawn chubbier, fatter, leaner, more masculine, more feminine, in any way underrepresented, please let me know!
- __Dynamic Posing.__ I will actively try to make the composition of your artwork more visually interesting.
- __Graphic Design.__ I like a good excuse to use my fonts.
- __Bunnies.__ <3

## What I'm Not Suited For:
- __NSFW.__ This will result in an automatic rejection.
- __Designing a Character.__ In the future, I might open up commissions specifically for reference sheets but designing a character is a completely different beast than illustrating an existing one and it usually requires 10x more revising, discussion, and time. For this reason, I will automatically reject designing entirely new characters.
- __Humans.__
- __Complex Backgrounds.__
- __Car Crashes.__
